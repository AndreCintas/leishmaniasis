Leishmaniasis Prediction Using Machine Learning
Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, presents a significant global health challenge.

Study Overview
This study focuses on applying artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically machine learning models, to predict leishmaniasis outbreaks in selected Brazilian cities.

Cities Studied
Visceral Leishmaniasis: Fortaleza/CE, Teresina/PI, and São Luís/MA
Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (including cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms): Manaus/AM, Rio Branco/AC, and Macapá/AP
